        "description": "Scene: Alley at dusk with a glowing light emerging from a storm drain. Characters: Adrian (5-7-year-old boy with voluminous short curly golden hair, bright blue eyes, casual hoodie over white crewneck), Alexander (8-10-year-old boy with short tousled brown hair, bright green eyes, layered hoodie and sleeveless zip vest), and Frau Müller (78-year-old woman, green/gray/beige outfit). Action: Boys peering into a drain, one hand reaching toward shimmering patterned light, Frau Müller leaning forward with a protective, wise expression. Lighting: warm watercolor glow from the drain illuminates faces; soft evening street light contrasts with bright inner glow. Mood: curious, slightly tense, wonder. Camera perspective: low-angle three-quarter view, slightly close-up to emphasize the children's reactions and the glowing patterns in the water. Environment specifics: narrow cobblestone alley, wet stone walls, small puddles reflecting light, faint citrus peel on the ground. Recurring motifs: light patterns and a whispering melody suggested by visual ripples. Art style: watercolor illustration, Axel Scheffler style, warm colours, child-friendly."

        "description": "Scene: Inside a narrow, damp tunnel entrance just below the alley, illuminated by ethereal glimmering light from the water and the glowing red aura around a small magical squirrel. Characters: Adrian (golden curly hair, bright blue eyes, casual hoodie/white crewneck), Alexander (tousled brown hair, bright green eyes, layered hoodie and zip vest), Frau Müller (78yo in green/gray/beige), and Squirrel Emma (red-brown fur, cream belly, black eyes with a red magical aura and glow). Action: Squirrel Emma is leaping up from a glittering whirlpool; Adrian placing a foot on a slippery stone while Alexander holds a string; Frau Müller handing the string to the boys. Lighting: magical inner glow from the water casts warm highlights; cooler tunnel shadows frame the scene. Mood: tense, brave, whimsical. Camera perspective: medium shot from slightly above to show the trio’s positions on the stones and the squirrel in mid-air. Environment specifics: mossy wet stones, woven light patterns on the water, scent of metal and crushed leaves implied. Recurring motifs: light patterns, the thin melody represented as visual ripples. Art style: watercolor illustration, Axel Scheffler style, warm colours, child-friendly."

        "description": "Scene: Inside a deeper underground passage with a large rusty gate. Characters: Adrian (golden curly hair, bright blue eyes, casual hoodie/white crewneck), Alexander (tousled brown hair, bright green eyes, layered hoodie and zip vest), Gärtnerin Rosa (40yo gardener in green/yellow/brown outfit holding a rake), and a tough street tomcat. Action: The group stands before a large rusted gate engraved with symbols (star, eye, scale). Adrian speaks softly while Alexander reasons; Rosa stands ready; the cat taps the gate's ring. Lighting: warm tunnel glow mixed with cool metallic highlights from the rust; dramatic side-lighting to emphasize textures. Mood: tense, puzzle-solving, slightly ominous.
