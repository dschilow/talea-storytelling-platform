    "positivePrompt": "Dynamic chase scene through apple trees: Alexander (olive-green hoodie, tousled chestnut hair, pointed ears visible) reaches out to catch a small golden hour (tiny disc with blinking 'eyes') while Adrian (golden ringlets, sky-blue eyes) watches, breathing sharply. Pip (red squirrel, green vest) leaps in front, scattering nut crumbs like tiny planets. The Nebelhexe appears shifting between a goat form and a shimmery woman with long gray hair and a pointed hat, eyes silver-gray. Frau Müller (round friendly face, floral dress, knitted cardigan) stands calm in the background holding a copper lamp. Lighting: dappled sunlight through leaves with mist glows. Mood: frantic but wondrous. Camera perspective: slightly low-angle, mid-action, showing motion blur on the jumping hour. Environment specifics: apple scents, bakery steam in distance, cold stone underfoot. Recurring motifs: glittering light threads, clock-chime giggle, copper lamp. Art style: watercolor illustration, Axel Scheffler style, warm colours, child-friendly.
